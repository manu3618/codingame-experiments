# Goal

Given a number N and a base B, output the highest palindromic prime lower than N.
Answer must be written in base B

A palindromic number is a number whose representation in base B is the remains the same is digits are reversed.
A palindormic prime is a number which is both palindromic and prime.

# Constraints
2 ≤ B ≤ 10
2 ≤ N ≤ 100000

# Example

## Input
10
10
